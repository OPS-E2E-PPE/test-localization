To avoid having to change connection strings on reporting clients, you can create a server [alias](analysis-services-server-alias.md) for your primary server. If the primary server goes down, you can change the alias to point to a redundant server in another region. You can automate alias to server name by coding an endpoint health check on the primary server. If the health check fails, the same endpoint can direct to a redundant server in another region. 

In either case, if your primary server experiences an outage, you must change the connection strings in reporting clients to connect to the server in a different regional datacenter. This change should be considered a last resort and only if a catastrophic regional data center outage occurs. It's more likely a data center outage hosting your primary server would come back online before you could update connections on all clients.
