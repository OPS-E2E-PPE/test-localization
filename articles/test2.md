To avoid having to change connection strings on reporting clients, you can create a server [alias](analysis-services-server-alias.md) for your primary server. If the primary server goes down, you can change the alias to point to a redundant server in another region. You can automate alias to server name by coding an endpoint health check on the primary server. If the health check fails, the same endpoint can direct to a redundant server in another region.
